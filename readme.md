## Summary
Island-bridge layout stretchable devices integrate a multitude of functional electronics in a lightweight, conformable, and small footprint form. These properties make such devices appealing candidates for many wearable, robotics, and diagnostics applications where it is desirable to deploy multiple sensing, transduction, and energy harvesting or storage elements compactly. Our work proposes a systematic approach to designing application-specific devices where target node locations and device dimensions are pre-constrained. The technique is based on a consolidated framework of parametric design, multi-scale finite element simulation, and mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization.
